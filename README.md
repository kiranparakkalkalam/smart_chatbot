# Smart Chatbot

A simple chatbot using NLTK library and based on `cosine simirality` score. 


# How it works
Flask webapp prompts the user to enter the query. Based on the `cosine similarity` score, from the already prepared corpus it will extract the appropriate response.

## Improvements

* Add more pages to the corpus.
* Make it more interactive, like a conversation.
* Add more test cases
